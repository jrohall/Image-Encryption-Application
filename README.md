Final Project Topic
-------------------

Image Encryption App

The purpose of this project is to make an encryption application that allows a user to both encrypt and decrypt an image. We want to make an application that is minimal, functional, and easy to use, even for someone with no experience in computers. Image encryption is something often used by the military, corporations, and the multimedia industry. The goal of this project is to bring this kind of service to everyday people for any application.


Project Milestones:
-------------------

GUI – Create a simple and easy to use GUI in Matlab, while also ensuring the visual aspect of this GUI is aesthetically pleasing.

Image Reading - Have Matlab assess and analyze images of various formats and sizes successfully. Matlab should both be able to read and pull data from an image.

Encryption Key – Creating an encryption program that is powerful enough to not be easily accessed without the use of the application.

Decryption Key – Creating a decryption program that can successfully decrypt any image produced by our encryption program in the same format it was given.
